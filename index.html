        <header id="HTML">This is HTML. It is use for making webpages. It stands for Hyoertext markup Language </header>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
        </p>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
        </p>

        <header id="CSS">This is CSS. It is use to style webpages. It stands for cascading syle sheet.</header>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>
        <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

        <header id="Javascript">This is Javascript. It is client side scripting Language</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls.

        <header id="C++">This is C++. It is server side language</header>
        <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

            C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
            
            C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
            </p>
        <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
            
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
            
            </p>
        <code>
            #include <iostream>

                int main() {
                    std::cout << "Hello World!";
                    return 0;

        <header id="php">This is php. It i server side language. It stands for hypertext markup language</header>
        <p>A PHP script is usually embedded into another language, such as HTML codes since a browser does not understand PHP.
        </p>
        <p>It is an open-source language. This means that PHP is freely available to use and implement.
            It is an easy-to-learn language. Since it is very similar to how HTML codes are written, it is easy to understand and implement.
            It is highly compatible since it can be integrated with multiple programming languages such as HTML, Javascript and supports different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
            It is platform-independent, which means that applications developed using PHP can run in any environment.
            </p>
